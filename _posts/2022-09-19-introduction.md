Hello! I am commonly known online as fluff/Ethan.
I hosted [Hunt20](https://ethannp.github.io/hunt20-static) awhile back and now I like to solve puzzles (mostly hunt puzzles but I have slowly been getting into logic puzzles as well!). I usually hunt with team Please Clap and occasionally 17th Shard.
